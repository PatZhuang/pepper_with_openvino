## run

```python
python2 cam.py
```

```python
python3 detection.py
```

`cam.py` runs on `python2` with naoqi python SDK installed.

`detection.py` runs on `python3` with openvino SDK installed.

Then you'll see a openCV window showing person detection results of pepper's front camera.

Other files are for testing only.
